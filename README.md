# magic-eight-project-generator
Background: When given an open-ended prompt I always overthink my options. I write lists of ideas and then
realize I just spent hours brainstorming when I could have been building. I get caught on the idea of the
perfect side project. The mythical thing that will showcase creativity while having absolutely no downsides.
Unfortunately, I have yet to find that idea. So I did what humans have been doing for years.
I outsourced my problem to technology. Because a text generator is no fun, I made it a magic eight ball.

This magic eight ball generates your next weekend project by stringing together an aesthetic, a project idea,
and a language/framework. It also links to documentation,in case you're unfamiliar with the technology
it suggests. 

To run this project cd into the node-express-api. Run npm start to launch the server.

Open up another tab in your terminal and cd into react-frontend. Run npm install. Next run npm start. 

Enjoy!
